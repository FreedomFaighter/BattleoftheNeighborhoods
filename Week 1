Introduction/Business Problem

For this project, I will be investigating where a good place to start an Asian restaurant would be.  I will be examining 5 different locations: New York, New Jersey, Boston,
Chicago, and San Fransisco.  Determining how many restaurants and how close they are to each other might provide adequete informaiton in where putting another location would be, 
although not considering population density or other demographic information by census track. 

Data 

For this project, I will be using Foursquare data to acquire where the Asian restaurant venues are. Also, google will be used to locate the latitude and longitude for mapping 
and venue placing purposes.
